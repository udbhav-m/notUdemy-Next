## CRUD Operations
The application allows you to perform CRUD operations on courses:

Create: Add a new course through the "Create Course" feature.
Read: View course details by navigating to a course's page.
Update: Edit course information by clicking the "Edit" button on a course's page.
Delete: Remove a course by clicking the "Delete" button on a course's page.

## To-Do
There are a few pending tasks:

Toasts for Alerts: Implement toast notifications for user alerts and notifications.
User-Side Functionality: Develop user-side functionality for purchasing and accessing courses.
